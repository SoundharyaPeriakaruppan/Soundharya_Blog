					<p>Welcome to my blog!</p>
					<p>I wear several hats. Professionally, I am a Senior Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET) with extensive experience in automation testing, Using tools like Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and Postman. My journey in the world of Quality Assurance (QA) has been both challenging and rewarding, and I am passionate about sharing my insights and learnings with others in the field.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have honed my skills in ensuring the highest quality of software through meticulous testing and innovative automation techniques. My expertise spans across various domains, including functional testing, performance testing, and security testing. I am always on the lookout for new technologies and methodologies that can enhance the QA process, and I enjoy exploring these in my blog.
					</p>
					<p>
						Beyond the world of code and testing, I am a passionate Bharatanatyam dancer. This classical Indian dance form has been a significant part of my life for many years. It not only provides me with a creative outlet but also instills discipline, balance, and grace. Through dance, I find a beautiful connection between tradition and expression, which enriches my life in many ways.
