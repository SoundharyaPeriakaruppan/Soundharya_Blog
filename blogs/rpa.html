        <h3><strong> What is RPA?</strong></h3>
        <div class="content">
            RPA stands for Robotic Process Automation. It's a technology that uses software robots (or bots) to automate repetitive tasks and processes that are usually performed by humans. These bots can mimic human actions like logging into applications, entering data, copying and pasting, and performing calculations. RPA aims to streamline workflows, increase efficiency, reduce errors, and free up human workers to focus on more complex and strategic tasks. It's often used in industries such as finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and customer service to automate routine and rule-based tasks.
